1. Declare variables with all primitive datatypes and print their values & typeof
2. What will be the output?
console.log(typeof null);
console.log(typeof NaN);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});
3. Create a variable x = "10" and y = 10.
Check x == y and x === y.
Explain the difference.
4. Create an array with mixed datatypes:Print each value and its type.
5. Write a program that:
Takes a number as input.
Converts it to string.
Then back to number.
Print type at each step.

6. Declare variables using var, let, and const. Print their values and explain the differences.

7. Can you reassign a value to a const variable? Try it and check what happens.

8.What will be the output?
var x = 10;
var x = 20;
console.log(x);

9. What happens if you declare a variable without var/let/const?
10. Predict the output:
	1. console.log(b);
	   let b = 20;

	2. console.log(b);
           let b = 20;
11. Create a block of code using { } and test variable behavior with var, let, and const.

	{
  	var x = 1;
  	let y = 2;
  	const z = 3;
	}
console.log(x); 
console.log(y); 
console.log(z);

12. What will be the output?
let a = 100;
{
  let a = 200;
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);

13. difference b/w Let  var const 
14. difference b/w == === 

15. Write a program using if...else to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
16. Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 10 using:
for loop
while loop
do...while loop

17. Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a loop.
----Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 50, but skip 5
18. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 50, but skip multiples of 5
19. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 20, but stop when the number is 7
20. Print the first 10 even numbers using a for loop.
21. Print the first 10 odd numbers using a while loop.
22. Print the multiplication table of 5 using a loop.
23. Write a switch statement program that prints the day of the week for a given number (1 = Monday, …, 7 = Sunday).
24. Write a program to print all numbers from 1–50, but:
	For multiples of 3 → print "Fizz"
	For multiples of 5 → print "Buzz"
	For multiples of 3 and 5 → print "FizzBuzz"

25. Difference b/w for in & for off loop 
26. Use for...in to print all keys of the object:
27. Use for...of on the array print values
28. Write a program to loop over this object using for...in and print both key & value:
let student = { name: "xyz", age: 22, grade: "A" };
28. Use for...of to loop over a string "JavaScript" and print each character.
29. Why does this code throw an error? How to fix it?
let user = { name: "Sam", age: 30 };
for (let val of user) {
  console.log(val);
}
30. Predict the output:

let nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.custom = "extra";

for (let i in nums) {
  console.log(i);
}

for (let val of nums) {
  console.log(val);
}
